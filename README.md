# Key Sequence Detection

Day 12 from the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) is quick and fun.  The code itself is quite simplistic but you can get really creative with your approach, which I love!

The idea of the website is simple - enter the Konami code to unlock a suprise.  In this case, the suprise is sparkly unicorns and rainbows.  Very 90's Lisa Frank.

## What I learned:
- cornify; as their [website](https://www.cornify.com/) describes it, "Cornify is the #1 unicorn and rainbow service worldwide, spreading sparkly happiness around the world"
- although I know about event.key, splicing an array, join, etc - putting all this knowledge together to produce such a silly result was fun, and isn't that what the web is all about?

## Stretch Features
- setting the secret code to the actual Konami code
- using animation in my css to give the website an arcade feel
